**Example:**
```

## 🎤 Voice-to-JSON Examples

Your AI parsing handles natural language perfectly:

```javascript
// Input: "I received $2500 salary payment today"
// Output: {amount: 2500, type: "income", category: "income", confidence: 0.9}

// Input: "Paid $120 for groceries at Walmart" 
// Output: {amount: 120, type: "expense", category: "groceries", confidence: 0.9}

// Input: "Bought coffee for $4.50 this morning"
