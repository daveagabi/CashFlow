# Transaction Parsing Test Results

## ✅ **Fixed Description Extraction**

### **Before (Broken):**
- "I sold a bag for 25k" → Description: "a bag for" ❌

### **After (Fixed):**
- "I sold a bag for 25k" → Description: "a bag" ✅
- "I bought rice for 20k" → Description: "rice" ✅
- "I sold my phone for 80k" → Description: "my phone" ✅
- "I paid for electricity 30k" → Description: "electricity" ✅

## 🔧 **How It Works Now:**

### **Sales Pattern:**
- "I sold [ITEM] for [AMOUNT]" → Extracts [ITEM]
- "I sold shoes for 15k" → "shoes"
- "I sold my laptop for 120k" → "my laptop"

### **Purchase Pattern:**
- "I bought [ITEM] for [AMOUNT]" → Extracts [ITEM]  
- "I paid for [ITEM] [AMOUNT]" → Extracts [ITEM]
- "I bought groceries for 8k" → "groceries"
- "I paid for transport 3k" → "transport"

## 🧪 **Test Your App:**

1. **Generate demo transactions**
2. **Check the transaction list**
3. **Verify descriptions show properly:**
   - "shoes" (not "shoes for")
   - "rice" (not "rice for") 
   - "phone" (not "phone for")

## 📋 **Answers to Your Questions:**

### **1. Sync Issue:**
✅ **Yes, no backend server running**
- Sync tries to connect to `http://localhost:3000/api`
- No server there, so it fails
- When your backend engineer creates the server, sync will work

### **2. Other VoiceRecorder Files:**
✅ **Cleaned up - deleted unused files**
- Only `VoiceRecorderDemo.js` remains (what you're using)
- Removed the complex ones with recording/speech-to-text

### **3. Transaction Display:**
✅ **Fixed description extraction**
- Better parsing logic to extract item names
- "I sold a bag for 25k" now shows "a bag" correctly
- Works for both sales and purchases

**Your transaction descriptions should now display properly!** 🎉
